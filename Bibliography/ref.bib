	32S + 94,96Zr and 40Ca + 94,96Zr are studied with the universal fusion
	function formalism and an empirical coupled channel (ECC) model.
	An examination of the reduced fusion functions shows that the total
	effect of couplings to inelastic excitations and neutron transfer
	channels on fusion in 32S + 94Zr (40Ca + 94Zr) is almost the same
	as that in 32S + 96Zr (40Ca + 96Zr). The enhancements of the fusion
	cross section at sub-barrier energies due to inelastic channel coupling
	and neutron transfer channel coupling are evaluated separately by
	using the ECC model. The results show that effect of couplings to
	inelastic excitations channels in the reactions with 94Zr as target
	should be similar as that in the reactions with 96Zr as target. This
	implies that the quadrupole deformation parameters $\beta$ 2 of 94Zr
	and 96Zr should be similar to each other. However, $\beta$ 2's predicted
	from the finite-range droplet model, which are used in the ECC model,
	are quite different. Experiments on 48Ca + 94Zr or 36S + 94Zr are
	suggested to solve the puzzling issue concerning $\beta$ 2 for 94Zr.},

	nuclei in the super-heavy mass region of Z = 110 and above with suitable
	choices of projectile and target nuclei. The cross sections for production
	of these nuclei are seen to be in the range of a few picobarn or
	less, and pose great experimental challenges. Theoretically, there
	have been extensive calculations for highly asymmetric (hot-fusion)
	and moderately asymmetric (cold-fusion) collisions and only a few
	theoretical studies are available for near-symmetric collisions to
	estimate the cross sections for production of super-heavy nuclei.
	In the present article, we revisit the symmetric heavy ion reactions
	with suitable combinations of projectile and target nuclei in the
	rare-earth region, that will lead to super-heavy nuclei of Z 猢�120
	with measurable fusion cross sections. },

	total, complete and incomplete fusion cross sections for reactions
	of the weakly bound 6Li with 144,154Sm targets at energies around
	the Coulomb barrier are presented. In the cluster structure frame
	of 6Li \rightarrow \alpha + d, short-range absorption potentials
	are considered for the interactions between the ground state of the
	projectile 6Li and alpha-d fragments with the target. In order to
	separately calculate complete and incomplete fusion and to reduce
	double-counting, the corresponding absorption potentials are chosen
	to be of different range. Couplings to low-lying excited states 2+,
	3- of 144Sm and 2+, 4+ of 154Sm are included. So, the effect on total
	fusion from the excited states of the target is investigated. Similarly,
	the effect on fusion due to couplings to resonance breakup states
	of 6Li, namely, l=2, J^\pi=3+, 2+, 1+ is also calculated. The latter
	effect is determined by using two approaches, (a) by considering
	only resonance state couplings and (b) by omitting these states from
	the full discretized energy space. Among other things, it is found
	that both resonance and non-resonance continuum breakup couplings
	produce fusion suppression at all the energies considered. A. Gomez

	It is found that the onset energy of rotational damping is around

	band structure is thus limited. The number of calculated rotational
	bands around 30 at a given angular momentum agrees qualitatively

	change is discussed within the conventional constrained Hartree鈥揊ock

	dynamics should be treated carefully, because the shape of the mean-field
	in such a finite many-body system as the nucleus strongly changes
	depending on its configuration. This situation is clearly shown by
	applying an adiabatic assumption, where the most energetically favorable
	single-particle states are assumed to be occupied. The excited HF
	states and the continuously-connected potential energy curves are

  abstract = {The synthesis of element 116 in fusion-evaporation reactions of a
	48Ca beam with radioactive 248Cm targets was studied at the velocity
	filter SHIP of GSI in Darmstadt. At excitation energies of the compound
	nuclei of 40.9MeV, four decay chains were measured, which were assigned
	to the isotope 292116, and one chain, which was assigned to 293116.
	Measured cross-sections of (3.4 鈭�.6 +2.7 ) pb and (0.9 鈭�.7 +2.1
	), respectively, and decay data of the chains agree with data measured
	previously at the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions in Dubna.
	As a new result, one $\alpha$-decay chain was measured, which terminates
	after four $\alpha$ decays by spontaneous fission. The $\alpha$ energies
	of the second-to-fourth decay are considerably higher than those
	measured for the $\alpha$ decays of 289114, 285Cn, and 281Ds and
	the spontaneous fission half-life is significantly longer than that
	of 277Hs measured in previous experiments. A possible assignment
	is discussed in the frame of excited quasiparticle states of nuclei
	populated in the decay chain from 293116. Also other possible assignments
	were considered and are discussed. At an excitation energy of 45.0MeV
	no events were observed resulting in a one-event cross-section limit
	of 1.6 pb. The technical aspects related with the use of radioactive
	target material at SHIP are described in detail. The experience gained
	in this experiment will serve as a basis for future experiments aiming
	to study still heavier elements at the velocity filter SHIP.},

	nuclear matter can be used as a tool for detecting finite-size instabilities
	for different Skyrme functionals. In particular, it has been shown
	that there is a correlation between the density at which instabilities
	occur in infinite matter and the instabilities in finite nuclei.
	In this paper, we present a new fitting protocol that uses this correlation
	to add a new additional constraint in symmetric infinite nuclear
	matter in order to ensure the stability of finite nuclei against
	matter fluctuation in all spin and isospin channels. As an application,
	we give the parameter set for a new Skyrme functional which includes
	central and spin鈥搊rbit parts and which is free from instabilities
	by construction.},

  volume = {79},

  number = {11},
  abstract = {This article reviews how nuclear fission is described within nuclear
	density functional theory. A distinction should be made between spontaneous
	fission, where half-lives are the main observables and quantum tunnelling
	the essential concept, and induced fission, where the focus is on
	fragment properties and explicitly time-dependent approaches are
	often invoked. Overall, the cornerstone of the density functional
	theory approach to fission is the energy density functional formalism.
	The basic tenets of this method, including some well-known tools
	such as the Hartree鈥揊ock鈥揃ogoliubov (HFB) theory, effective two-body
	nuclear potentials such as the Skyrme and Gogny force, finite-temperature
	extensions and beyond mean-field corrections, are presented succinctly.
	The energy density functional approach is often combined with the
	hypothesis that the time-scale of the large amplitude collective
	motion driving the system to fission is slow compared to typical
	time-scales of nucleons inside the nucleus. In practice, this hypothesis
	of adiabaticity is implemented by introducing (a few) collective
	variables and mapping out the many-body Schr枚dinger equation into
	a collective Schr枚dinger-like equation for the nuclear wave-packet.
	The region of the collective space where the system transitions from
	one nucleus to two (or more) fragments defines what are called the
	scission configurations. The inertia tensor that enters the kinetic
	energy term of the collective Schr枚dinger-like equation is one of
	the most essential ingredients of the theory, since it includes the
	response of the system to small changes in the collective variables.
	For this reason, the two main approximations used to compute this
	inertia tensor, the adiabatic time-dependent HFB and the generator
	coordinate method, are presented in detail, both in their general
	formulation and in their most common approximations. The collective
	inertia tensor enters also the Wentzel鈥揔ramers鈥揃rillouin (WKB) formula
	used to extract spontaneous fission half-lives from multi-dimensional
	quantum tunnelling probabilities (For the sake of completeness, other
	approaches to tunnelling based on functional integrals are also briefly
	discussed, although there are very few applications.) It is also
	an important component of some of the time-dependent methods that
	have been used in fission studies. Concerning the latter, both the
	semi-classical approaches to time-dependent nuclear dynamics and
	more microscopic theories involving explicit quantum-many-body methods
	are presented. One of the hallmarks of the microscopic theory of
	fission is the tremendous amount of computing needed for practical
	applications. In particular, the successful implementation of the
	theories presented in this article requires a very precise numerical
	resolution of the HFB equations for large values of the collective
	variables. This aspect is often overlooked, and several sections
	are devoted to discussing the resolution of the HFB equations, especially
	in the context of very deformed nuclear shapes. In particular, the
	numerical precision and iterative methods employed to obtain the
	HFB solution are documented in detail. Finally, a selection of the
	most recent and representative results obtained for both spontaneous
	and induced fission is presented, with the goal of emphasizing the
	coherence of the microscopic approaches employed. Although impressive
	progress has been achieved over the last two decades to understand
	fission microscopically, much work remains to be done. Several possible
	lines of research are outlined in the conclusion.},

	and quasi-fission is studied for reactions forming heavy elements.
	Measurements of fission fragment mass distributions for different
	reactions leading to similar compound nuclei have been made near
	the fusion barrier. In general, more quasi-fission is observed for
	reactions with non-magic nuclei. However, the 40Ca + 208Pb reaction
	is an exception, showing strong evidence for quasi-fission, though
	both nuclei are doubly magic. Time-dependent Hartree鈥揊ock calculations
	predict fast equilibration of N / Z in the two fragments early in
	the collision. This transfer of nucleons breaks the shell effect,
	causing this reaction to behave more like a non-magic one in the
	competition between fusion and quasi-fission. Future measurements
	of fission in reactions with exotic beams should be able to test
	this idea with larger N / Z asymmetries. },

  abstract = {The fusion excitation function of 48Ca&#xa0;+&#xa0;48Ca has been measured
	above and well below the Coulomb barrier, thereby largely extending
	the energy range of a previous experiment down to very low cross
	sections. This system has a negative Q-value for compound nucleus
	formation. The fusion cross section decreases steadily below the
	barrier with no conspicuous change of slope below 鈮�300 渭b . Coupled-channels
	calculations using a Woods鈥揝axon potential indicate that a large
	diffuseness parameter is needed to reproduce the sub-barrier cross
	sections. A close analogy with the case of 36S&#xa0;+&#xa0;48Ca,
	with Q &gt; 0 , is pointed out. The sign of the Q-value does not
	influence fusion cross sections down to the 300鈥�00 nb level. },

  year = {1990},
  volume = {16},
  pages = {867},
  number = {7},
  abstract = {In atomic molecules the atoms share their valence electrons. Similarly,
	in a nucleus-nucleus collision nuclear molecules are formed when
	the outermost bound nucleons move in molecular orbits. Unique signatures
	of the formation of molecular orbits and consequently of nuclear
	molecules arise in those reaction channels which involve enhanced
	nucleon promotion due to the avoided crossing of molecular single
	nucleon levels ('nuclear Landau-Zener effect'). The author reviews
	the present status of the investigation of the nuclear Landau-Zener
	effect in light heavy ion reactions within the framework of the molecular
	particle-core approach. Semiclassical treatments and the molecular
	particle-core model, which is a quantum mechanical molecular reaction
	theory describing valence nucleon orbits by eigenstates of the two-centre
	shell model, give cross sections with specific signatures of the
	Landau-Zener effect. Dynamic reaction calculations within the molecular
	particle-core model for the 17 O+ 12 C reaction are discussed. For
	heavier scattering systems molecular level diagrams are calculated
	with the two-centre shell model to predict enhanced transitions of
	nucleons.},

	energies},
  journal = {Chin. Sci. Bull.},
  year = {2017},
  note = {{in Chinese}},
  abstract = {In recent decades, the study of capture and fusion dynamics in heavy-ion
	collisions has been a subject of intense experimental and theoretical
	interests because the heavy-ion capture not only is of central importance
	for nucleosynthesis but also can reveal rich interplay between nuclear
	structure and reaction dynamics. Theoretically, the heavy-ion capture
	and fusion processes at energies near the Coulomb barrier can be
	treated as a multidimensional barrier penetration problem. The multidimensional
	barrier penetration process can be described by solving the coupled-channel
	equations, i.e., the coupled-channel (CC) model. However, for heavy
	reaction systems, it is necessary to take into account a large number
	of channels which is not easy to realize in the CC model. Moreover,
	the structure information of the interacting nuclei are needed as
	inputs. Therefore, full CC calculations become intractable in many
	cases including many fusion reactions leading to superheavy nuclei.
	On the other hand, in the eigenchannel framework, the couplings to
	other channels split the single potential barrier into a set of discrete
	barriers. Based on the concept of the barrier distribution, several
	empirical CC approaches have been developed. Recently, we have developed
	an empirical coupled-channel (ECC) model and performed a systematic
	study of capture excitation functions for 220 reaction systems. In
	this ECC model, an asymmetric Gaussian-form barrier distribution
	function was used to take effectively into account the effects of
	inelastic excitation couplings and neutron transfer coupling. Based
	on the interaction potential between the projectile and the target,
	empirical formulas were proposed for the parameters of the barrier
	distribution according to the static and dynamical deformations of
	the two colliding nuclei. For the vibrational coupling effect and
	the rotational coupling effect, the parameters of the empirical formulas
	were given, respectively. For spherical reaction systems (vibrational
	coupling effect), the width of the barrier distribution increases
	with the charge product of the reaction system, while for the deformed
	reaction systems (rotational coupling effect), besides the charge
	product of the reaction system, the width of the barrier distribution
	is also related to the static deformation parameters of the projectile
	and the target. For some reaction systems, the coupling effects of
	the positive Q-value neutron transfer (PQNT) channels are needed
	to explain the enhancement of sub-barrier capture cross sections.
	In this ECC model, the effects of PQNT are simulated by broadening
	the barrier distribution. Moreover, the positive Q value for one
	neutron pair transfer is used to broaden the barrier distribution
	in the present model. Among these 220 reaction systems, there are
	89 systems with positive Q value for one neutron pair transfer channel.
	The calculated capture cross sections of most of these 89 reaction
	systems are in good agreement with the experimental values, which
	implies that the Q value for one neutron pair transfer is very important
	to understanding of the coupling to PQNT channels. Generally speaking,
	the ECC model together with the empirical formulas for parameters
	of the barrier distribution works quite well in the description of
	the capture cross sections at near-barrier energies. This model can
	provide useful information on capture dynamics and predictions of
	capture cross sections for the synthesis of superheavy nuclei. In
	the present paper, we will review this ECC model and its applications.},

	an empirical coupled-channel (ECC) model. In this model, a barrier
	distribution is used to take effectively into account the effects
	of couplings between the relative motion and intrinsic degrees of

	estimates for barrier distributions and calculated capture cross
	sections together with experimental cross sections of 220 reaction

  abstract = {Applying a macroscopic reduction procedure to the improved quantum
	molecular dynamics (ImQMD) model, the energy dependences of the nucleus-nucleus
	potential, the friction parameter, and the random force characterizing
	a one-dimensional Langevin-type description of the heavy-ion fusion
	process are investigated. Systematic calculations with the ImQMDmodel
	show that the fluctuation-dissipation relation found in symmetric
	head-on fusion reactions at energies just above the Coulomb barrier
	fades out when the incident energy increases. It turns out that this
	dynamical change with increasing incident energy is caused by a specific
	behavior of the friction parameter which directly depends on the
	microscopic dynamical process, i.e., on how the collective energy
	of the relative motion is transferred into the intrinsic excitation
	energy. It is shown microscopically that the energy dissipation in
	the fusion process is governed by two mechanisms: One is caused by
	the nucleon exchanges between two fusing nuclei, and the other is
	due to a rearrangement of nucleons in the intrinsic system. The former
	mechanism monotonically increases the dissipative energy and shows
	a weak dependence on the incident energy, while the latter depends
	on both the relative distance between two fusing nuclei and the incident
	energy. It is shown that the latter mechanism is responsible for
	the energy dependence of the fusion potential and explains the fading
	out of the fluctuation-dissipation relation.

	without any symmetry restrictions. The full Skyrme energy functional
	is incorporated in our TDHF implementation. The quasifission dynamics
	is quite sensitive to the angular momentum of colliding system. The
	contact time of quasifission decreases as a function of angular momentum
	and then forms a plateau with small oscillations. The quasifission
	process is accompanied by an important multi-nucleon transfer. The
	quantum shell effect plays a crucial role in the mass and charge
	of quasifission fragments. The mass-angle distribution of the fragments
	is calculated, which can be compared directly with future experiments.},

	of the existence limits of the charge and mass of atomic nuclei is
	at the forefront of modern science.The existence of superheavy nuclei
	is mainly due to quantum shell effects. In the 1960s,based on the
	stability originating from shell effects, it was predicted that an
	island of stability centered at Z=114 and N=184 should exist. This
	prediction advanced the construction of heavy ion accelerators and
	related detectors and the development of heavy ion physics. So far,
	new elements with a charge number up to 118 have been synthesized
	in laboratories. The elements with Z=116 and 114 and Z<113 have already
	been named. There are many challenges to synthesize even heavier
	elements by using heavy ion fusion reactions. More efforts should
	be made to study the properties of superheavy nuclei both experimentally
	and theoretically. In this article, the background, experimental
	progress, and challenges concerning the study of superheavy nuclei
	will be presented,and future prospects discussed.},

	实验室合成了118号及之前的超重元素。其中116号、114号和113号以下的新元素已被命名。利用重离子熔合反应合成更重的超重元素还面临着很多挑战，需要理论与实验密切结合，探索超重原子核性质与合成机制，以登上超重稳定岛。文章概要介绍了超重原子核和超重元素的研究背景、实验进展以及面临的挑战，并展望了未来的发展。国家重点基础研究发展计划(批准号：2013CB834400)、国家自然科学基金(批准号：11121403，11120101005，11211120152，11275248)资助项目；中国科学院知识创新工程重要方向项目(批准号：KJCX2-EW-N01)；本文部分计算工作得到中国科学院理论物理研究所及理论物理国家实验室高性能计算平台和中国科学院计算机网络信息中心超级计算中心的支持},
