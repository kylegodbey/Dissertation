From all scales ...
Nuclear interactions affect all

infinite nuclear matter
finite nuclei and their structure
static systems rare in nature, firm understanding of dynamics and reactions

Broad picture of dynamics of nuclear systems
focus on reactions and collisions between two nuclei
Studies can be broadly separated into time scales of reactions
though in practice, experimental studies include events from all

sec1 time scales
sec2 methods to study reactions
